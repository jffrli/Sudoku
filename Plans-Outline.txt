Sudoku Generator/Solver
To be written in Java(?)
	Generator: Randomly generate some numbers, solve, then remove as many numbers as possible while still solvable in the same way
		Backtracking to check different ways of removing numbers
		Requires solving to be done first
	Solver:
		Needs lots of logic
		Check for rows, columns, and squares
		"ghost numbers" (?)
			numbers whose location is uncertain, but must be in a row or column
		other strategies?
			noting every possible location of every number
				filling when only one possibility
	Board:
		Square: contains 3x3 int array
			use static to keep track of which position it's in (?)
			methods:
				check if a number is in a row/column of the square
				check if a number is in the square
				check if a number is board generated or user inputed
				input a number into a space (user and origin segregated)
				get all numbers in a row/column/square
		Board: 3x3 array of squares
			methods:
				check if a number is in a row/column/square by calling square methods
				put a number into a space by calling square methods
				check if valid solution
					get all numbers in a row/column/square
